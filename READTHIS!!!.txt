The main script is called "TransmissionFileType1.ps1"

What does this script do?

	Run the script as an administrator.
	It creates a folder(s), if they have not been created yet, in the Download directory. 
	Then it sorts the files in the Download directory, depending on their extension, into the necessary folders. 
	For example, we have a folder named "exeFiles". All files with the .exe extension will be sorted into this folder. 
	The script works automatically.  Just click on the icon of the script file, a PowerShell window will open. 
	All unsorted files will be sorted. To disable the script, simply close the PowerShell window. 

P.S. If the PowerShell window is always open, but you want the script to always work, then just run the file "HiddentSetupScript.bat". 
Before that, do not forget to open it using Notepad (or any other text editor) and specify the path to the script file there.

How do you edit the script? Well, for example, add a new extension and a folder for it. 

Everything is simple. Most often it will be CTRL C + CTRL V. Be sure to read the comments.

1) At the very top, create a variable using "$". You can give any name, but it is desirable to give something meaningful (for example, for *.exe files, name the variable "exeFiles").
After the "=" sign in quotation marks, you need to write the path by which the folder should be created, in which the files you need will be sorted.
2) Copy this code: 

If (-Not (Test path is Path $imageDest)) _BOS_
       New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $imageDest
   }

Replace $imageDest with the name of your variable (for example, $archiveDest) that you created (be sure to check the case, spaces, and the like). 
This part of the code will create a folder along the path that you specified when executing step 1)
Paste the received code before the comment: # Перемещение файлов и бесконечный цикл для работы в фоне

3) Copy this code: 

elseif ($_.Extension -Equalizer ".zip") {
Move-Element -Path $_.Full name -destination $archiveDest
}


Change it."zip" in the part of the code that is on top of the extension you need. replace $archiveDest with the variable from point 1) 
Paste the resulting code in front of the closing curly brace "}". This parenthesis will be placed before the comment: # Задержка перед следующей проверкой
, i.e. your code should be in a while loop. 

Congratulations, you have added a new extension for the script. That's all.
